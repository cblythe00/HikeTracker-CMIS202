# HikeTracker-CMIS202
The HikeTracker is a software that stores user inputs such as hike names and locations in files for quick
and easy access. The program is designed for someone who may not want to use an app that requires internet
connection or just wants a simple way to store their favorite trails. When opened, a table is shown and
the user may open previosuly made files. The user can add new hikes which will then be added to the
table for easy viewing.

It is somewhat incomplete in it's current state. The open, save, and add buttons and I will be adding functionality
to the rest soon. I also plan on implementing more ways to sort through the data, something like choosing a
distance that you want the hikes to be more or less than.
