# HikeTracker-CMIS202
The HikeTracker is a software that stores user inputs such as hike names and locations in files for quick
and easy access. The program is designed for someone who may not want to use an app that requires internet
connection or just wants a simple way to store their favorite trails. When opened, a table is shown and
the user may open previosuly made files. The user can add new hikes which will then be added to the
table for easy viewing.

After this revision, the open, save, delete, and add buttons work while the edit and remove hike buttons
do not. They will receive fundtionality in the next update. A completely new feature was added as well, 
this being the recently added hike message in the top right. It will notify you on the last hike added
using a priorityQueue.
